\title{Multiple species calculation of trophic position}
\usage{
multiSpeciesTP(siDataList = siDataList, lambda = 2, n.chains = 2,
  n.adapt = 20000, n.iter = 20000, burnin = 20000, thin = 10,
  model = "oneBaseline", print = FALSE, quiet = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{siDataList}{a named list of isotopeData class objects.}

\item{lambda}{numerical value, represents the trophic level for baseline(s).}

\item{n.chains}{number of parallel chains for the model. If convergence
diagnostics (such as Gelman-Rubin) are printed, n.chains needs to be >= 2.}

\item{n.adapt}{number of adaptive iterations, before the actual sampling.}

\item{n.iter}{number of iterations for Bayesian modelling (posterior
sampling).}

\item{burnin}{number of iterations discarded as burn in.}

\item{thin}{thinning. Number of samples discarded while performing posterior
sampling.}

\item{model}{string or list representing Bayesian models. At the moment they
can be "oneBaseline", "twoBaselines" and/or "twoBaselinesFull".}

\item{print}{logical value to indicate whether Gelman and Rubin's convergence
diagnostic and summary of samples are printed.}

\item{quiet}{logical value to indicate whether messages generated during
compilation will be suppressed, as well as the progress bar during
adaptation.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to this function.}
}
\value{
A list of 4 elements. The output is organised as lists nested. The
  first element (multiSpeciesTP) has the gg data frame returned by
  multiModelTP, the second element (df) is a data frame with summary
  information for all consumers and models, the third element (TPs) has the
  raw posterior trophic position for all consumers and models, and the last
  element (Alphas) has raw posterior of muDeltaN (if one baseline model was
  chosen) or alpha (if a two baselines model was chosen) for all consumers
  and models.
}
\description{
This function takes a named list of isotopeData class objects and calculates
one or more Bayesian models of trophic position for each element of the list.
